# Run this code to pull in the data sources and prepare them for visualization 
# Only needs to be run when updating the APC or GTFS data
# Visualization.Rmd produces all of the visuales from prepared data stored in repo

#Basic work flow:
#  Calculate ridership per trip per stop for each week
#  Calculate how many trips per day serve that stop for that week
#  Multiply per trip per stop ridership by trips per day for each stop 
#  Aggregate new daily per stop ridership (by week) to census tracts/planning districts
#  Produce visuals

#thigns to add:
#  - route level visuals (including income by route data)
#  - convert run.R to store all of the outputs into files that are red into the rmd file 
#     (this will mean you don't need to run run.R to see the visualizations each time)

#### Import Data ---------------------------------------- ####
